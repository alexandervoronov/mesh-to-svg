# Mesh to SVG

WASM Library (written in Rust ðŸ¦€) to convert meshes (optionally with supplemental wireframe mesh) into an SVG line drawing

It is recommended to use https://github.com/zakhenry/svg-from-wireframe which wraps this library in a more ergonomic interface,
and provides demos for how to integrate with webworkers in Angular.

## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add mesh-to-svg
```
